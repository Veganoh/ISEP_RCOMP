  * The WiFi channels to be used are the channels: 1, 6 and 11
  * For each outlet it is assumed to have 1 person working
  * For each person there are 2 devices connecting to the WiFi
  * An AP can only connect up to 30 devices without losing performance 
  * There must be an outlet for each AP
  * The AP must all be on the ceiling
  * When connecting the MC to the different IC the cables used are fiber
  * When connecting the IC to the different HC and then the HC to the outlets and such, the cables used are copper
  * The copper cable standard to be addopeted is the 568B
  * The cooper cable type to be used is CAT7
  * Patch coords for enclosures have a length of 0.5m
  * The fiber cables to use must be 12 strand fiber optic cable due to redundancy and price/safety ratio
  * The outlets will be around 0.5m from the ground
